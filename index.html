                <p>When America chose to use Korea as its battleground for fighting communism, it
                affected millions of lives and created a perpetual link between the two countries. Koreans were
                forever brought into the American political sphere and subsequently exposed to the culture and
                ideals of the United States. Many immigrated to America, only to face race-based violence but
                also to create beautiful communities and purpose here.<br><br>
                <!-- Within Korean culture it is common to reduce one's struggles under the guise of being
                grateful for the opportunities that one has. The model minority myth tells us that the most
                important thing to do keep our head down, work hard, and with that we will be able to break
                through barriers and achieve economic success.<br><br>
                However, in the suppression of our hardships, our stories also get lost. -->
                 This is my attempt at
                exposing the historical context within which my family exists, to create a better
                understanding of white supremacy and Asian stereotypes within the American context 
                by demonstrating how they effect
                individuals.
